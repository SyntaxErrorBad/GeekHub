In Winter I get up at night
And dress by yellow candle light.
In Summer, quite the other way,
I have to go to bed by day.
I have to go to bed and see
The birds still hopping on the tree,
Or hear the grown-up people’s feet
Still going past me in the street.

And does it hard not seem to you,
When all the sky is clear and blue,
And I should like so much to play,
To have to go to bed by day?
